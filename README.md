### Soccer game with deep reinforcement learning
In this environment, the goal is to train a team of agents to play soccer.

You can read more about this environment in the ML-Agents GitHub [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#soccer-twos). To solve this harder task, you'll need to download a new Unity environment. (Note: Udacity students should not submit a project with this new environment.)

You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

Linux: click here [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer_Linux.zip)
Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Soccer/Soccer.app.zip)
Then, place the file in the p3_collab-compet/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file. Next, open Soccer.ipynb and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

(For AWS) If you'd like to train the agents on AWS (and have not enabled a virtual screen), then please use this link to obtain the "headless" version of the environment. You will not be able to watch the agents without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agents. (To watch the agents, you should follow the instructions to enable a virtual screen, and then download the environment for the Linux operating system above.)
